### Recommendations
Based on the insights gathered from the dashboard and exploratory data analysis, the following actions are recommended to improve business performance, optimize operations, and drive customer value:
1. Optimize Discounting Strategy
- The analysis revealed a clear negative correlation between high discounts and profitability, especially in the Furniture and Office Supplies categories.
- Implement dynamic discounting models that only trigger when needed (e.g., to move slow inventory or retain high-CLV customers).
- Evaluate the ROI of discount campaigns regularly to ensure discounts are driving profit, not just sales.
2. Invest in High-Performing Categories
- Technology products consistently generated the highest profits with fewer discounts applied.
- Allocate more marketing and inventory budgets to Technology and high-margin sub-categories such as Phones, Copiers, and Accessories.
- Consider bundling underperforming products with top-sellers to improve overall category performance.
3. Strengthen Regional Strategies
- The West region leads in both sales and profit—analyzing operational practices in this region can provide a blueprint for improving performance in lower-performing regions like the South and Central.
- Tailor regional marketing strategies based on localized insights (e.g., promotions, top-selling sub-categories per state).
4. Leverage CLV Insights for Customer Retention
- Introduce loyalty or retention programs targeting high-CLV customers, who generate consistent revenue over time.
- Focus customer service and upsell efforts on top-tier customers as identified in the CLV analysis.
- For low-CLV customers, investigate engagement strategies like tailored promotions or win-back campaigns.
5. Improve Seasonal Planning
- Q4 repeatedly shows peak sales activity—likely influenced by Black Friday, holiday shopping, and end-of-year budget spending.
- Plan inventory, staffing, and marketing campaigns to align with seasonal demand, particularly from October to December.
- Run seasonal offers with careful monitoring of discounts and profit margins.
6. Enhance Product Portfolio Management
- Regularly review underperforming products (e.g., Tables, Bookcases) for pricing updates, product improvements, or promotional efforts.
- Phase out products with persistent losses unless strategic value exists (e.g., loss-leaders or bundled products).
7. Adopt Predictive Analytics
- Incorporate predictive models to forecast demand, CLV progression, and churn probability.
- Use these models to identify customers at risk of leaving and trigger proactive engagement strategies.
